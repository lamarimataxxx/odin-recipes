    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix the chicken with the teriyaki sauce. Set aside in the
        fridge to marinate for 15 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, cook the noodles to pack instructions. Drain well, then toss
        with the sesame oil and soy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the broccoli. Cook for 5
        mins, adding the mangetout for the final 3 mins. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large griddle pan over a high heat until hot and almost smoking.
        Working in batches, griddle the chicken, pouring over any marinade left
        in the bowl, for 1-2 mins each side until fully cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, divide the noodles between plates and top with the veg and
        griddled chicken. Garnish with the chilli, spring onions and sesame
        seeds, and drizzle with a little extra sesame oil, if you like.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip: </strong>The chicken can be marinated in a non-metal
      container in the fridge up to 24 hrs in advance.
